# Truck Shipment Efficiency Dashboard â€“ Glovis (Summer 2025)

This Power BI dashboard was built during my internship at Hyundai Glovis to monitor and improve weekly outbound/inbound efficiency of truck shipments by port.

---

## ðŸšš Project Overview

Aimed at reducing dwell times and improving outbound flow, this dashboard highlights shipment inefficiencies across U.S. ports by tracking VIN-level vehicle movements, summarized weekly.

---

## ðŸ§  Business Logic

- **Inbound Event:** `TENDER_DATE` (unit released for shipment)
- **Outbound Event:** `SHIPMENT_DATE` (unit shipped)
- **Filter:** Only `TRANS_TYPE = 'Truck'` vehicles
- **Group By:** WeekStart Ã— Port Ã— Carrier Ã— Customer
- **Ratio:** `Total Outbound Units / Total Inbound Units`

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- **Outflow:Inflow Ratio Trendline**
- **VIN-level Drilldown Table**
- **Carrier & Customer Slicers**
- **Alert Flags:** Ratio drops, 3-week performance dips
- **Sparkline & Bar Charts** for past 12 weeks

---

## ðŸ§± Data Modeling

- Power Query used to create `InEvents`, `OutEvents`, `MasterEvents`
- Weekly aggregation logic using `WeekStart`
- Separate summary table `WeeklyRatios_Truck`
- Clean column naming, outlier detection, and scalable structure

---

## ðŸ”„ Tools Used

- Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, visualization)
- MongoDB via ODBC (VIN-level raw data)
- Excel & Python (future automation and forecasting integrations)
